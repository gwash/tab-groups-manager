  # Works with Pentadactyl and latest version of TabGroups Manager

  # Commands prefixed with 'tabgroup-' (instead of 'group-')
  
  # Group completion uses group icon (instead of active tab's favicon)
  
  # Group navigation (v-left/right) skips suspended groups
  
  # Suspended groups are indicated as so in group-list (:tabgroup)
  
  # Added commands:
  
  # Removed commands:
	:tabgroupgooglesearch
	:grouptabnext
	:grouptabprevious

  # Fixed bugs:
	too many to count!
